use ui-sref-active A-directive for the navbar buttons
	some other useful stuff here: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/Quick-Reference#ui-sref-active

put sessions in
	look at auther workshop
		attach userId to session, then use middleware to get user and attach it to the requests (maybe order middleware so user is only loaded for requests that would need the current User -- unless the time saved is negligible)
	uses express session
